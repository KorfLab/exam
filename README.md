The KorfLab Bioinformatics Exam
===============================

The Korf Lab performs bioinformatics experiments in a Linux command-line
environment. In order for you to contribute to our scientific mission, you must
have some experience in the following technologies:

+ Linux - we do everything in Linux/Unix
+ Python - the default programming language, but not the only one
+ GitHub - where all of our code is maintained
+ Markdown - how documents are made
+ FASTA, FASTQ - standard sequence formats
+ GFF, BED - standard annotation formats
+ TSV, CSV, JSON, YAML - standard interchange formats

This exam is designed to test your current knowledge and skills. If you find
yourself pulling answers from the Internet instead of your brain, you need more
practice. Practice means repetition.


+ CLI
+ Unix stuff
+ Debug data
+ Negative controls
+ Positive controls
